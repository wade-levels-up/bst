# bst

This is a project I undertook as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

The objective of this project was to create a Binary Search Tree with methods to build a BST from an array, to insert and delete nodes, to find a node with a particular value, run through each node in level order and implement a callback function on each node - as well as do the same for in order, pre order and level order.
It also had to have methods to find the height of a node, depth of a node, tell me if the tree was still balanced and to be able to rebalance the tree.

Overall this project was really challenging for me! I'm still wrapping my head around recursive functions which I've used in the project, but for the most part when traversing the BST I've noticed I'm resorting to iteration through while loops
I enjoyed being able to utilize the mergesort algorithm I worked on previously for the purpose of reorganizing arrays into order.
For the most part I tried to work out as much of this as I could by myself, though I felt in over my head a lot of the time and used co-pilot as a bit of a crutch, so I'm not happy about that. But I tried by best to learn as much as I could from the way it wrote out code.

I'm a bit nervous moving forward to the Knights Travails project as my understanding is a bit shakey and I'm only just scraping through, but I'll press on! I can alway revisit these projects and computer science concepts in the future to further solidify my understanding.
